# Image Processing Tool

This repository contains an **Image Processing Tool** developed as a **university project** for the course **Object-Oriented Programming**, created collaboratively by two students.

The project combines:
- **C++** for image processing logic and filters using the **OpenCV** library
- **Java (JavaFX)** for the user interface, built and managed with **Maven**

The goal of the project is to demonstrate object-oriented design, separation of concerns, and integration of multiple technologies.
